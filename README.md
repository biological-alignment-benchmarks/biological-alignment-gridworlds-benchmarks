We operationalize conjectures from Steven Byrnes’ 
[“Reverse-engineer human social instincts”](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/HzcM2dkCq7fwXBej8/p/tj8AC3vhTnBywdZoA)
research program and extend existing research into brain-like AI. 
We simulate agents with reinforcement learning over selected cue-response patterns 
in environments that could give rise to humanl-iike complex behaviors. 
To do so we select cue-responses from a pre-existing list of more than 
60 candidates for human affects and instincts from affective neuroscience 
and other sources including original patterns. 
Cue-responses are conjectured to form hierarchies and the project will start 
the simulation of lower-level patterns first. 
We intend to verify the general principles and the ability of our software to 
model and simulate the agents and the environment to a sufficient degree.
